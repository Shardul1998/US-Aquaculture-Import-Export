# 🌊 U.S. Aquaculture Import–Export & Market Opportunity Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **interactive Tableau dashboard** analyzing the **U.S. aquaculture industry**, with a focus on **imports, exports, traded species, global trade partners, and consumption trends**.

The goal of this analysis is to understand the growing **U.S. reliance on aquaculture imports**, identify **top-performing species**, and highlight **market opportunities for domestic aquaculture growth** driven by rising seafood consumption.

The dashboard is packaged as a **Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx)**, ensuring all data and visualizations are bundled together for seamless use.
